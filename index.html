			    <h1>What is Stochastik Drum Machine?</h1>
			    
			    <p>Stochastik is a fantastic Drum Machine with some killer features.  Unlike any other drum machine, Stochastik lets you set a <b>probability</b> that a note will trigger for each of the  steps in your pattern.
			    </p><p>
          Once you add chance into the mix, you can generate thousands of unique variations <b>automatically</b>, in the time it takes to sequence two bars.  It's as easy as programming a loop but it generates a dynamic track: no more boring loops!  Hundreds of high-quality samples are included, from classic analog drum machines of the past to pristine acoustic jazz and rock kits. Plus, you can import your own samples through iTunes File Sharing.
          <p>
          Create an awesome kit, pattern or song and you can easily share and collaborate with your friends through email or iTunes File Sharing.
          </p>
			    <h1>What makes Stochastik different?</h1>
          <p> <b>You can generate millions of variations from 
          a single pattern.</b> We start with a fantastic drum machine and add the power of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process">Stochastic Process</a> to generate dynamic beats. In the time it takes to set up a single measure, you can generate thousands of unique variations. You just set up your basic rhythm and layer on some notes that trigger occasionally; as Stochastik runs, the Stochastik Process will run the combinatorics and produce dynamic beats that sound great and keep it interesting.
          </p><p>
             To get started with this new style of drum programming, Stochastik comes stocked with tons of patterns ready to learn from and play. Are you into Dance, Hip-Hop, Rock, Jazz, Funk, Glitch or Techno music? We have loads of pre-made kits that are easy to get started.  With the ability to load in your <b>custom samples</b> through <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4094">iTunes File Sharing</a>, you can make Stochastik sound just the way you want.
          <br/><br/>
          Finally, a drum machine that makes it easy to have tons of variation.
          <br/><b>No more boring loops</b>.
